            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p> Premo Italiano prides itself on fresh, quality ingredients, passion and flavor; we also take our food very seriously.
                <br>Our pizzas spring from a rich family tradition of pie making, dating back to Naples in the 1800's in the old country.
                <br>Every chef here is an artisan, and every customer a rightful critic, so we strive to achieve perfection with each pizza we create.
                <br>Pizza is more than just food to us here, it's a calling. A calling to create an experience for our customers. A joyful one.
                <br>From that calling comes hard-work, craft, and a variety of unique flavors and toppings that we have originated over the decades.
                <br>Try our zesty pepperoni, or our luscious white pies, with basil, olive oil and fresh, leafy greens. You won't leave unsatisfied.
                <br>In the mood for something different? Sample our award-winning pastrami. Or our fresh-brewed italian coffee with scones.
                <br>Come to where the pasion is: Premo Italiano. We live for food, and it shows. Put us to the test.</p>
