            <h3>~ A Hyrulian History ~</h3>
            <p>Long ago, lost in the mists of time, there was the realm of Hyrule. Protected by the three triforces sent from the Elder Spirits, Hyrule prospered with verdant fields, art, culture and progress. Then from the shadows,<br>
                the Gerudo thief chieftan Ganondorf Dragmire, cut a bloody path to the very golden realm to steal the triforce of power for his own wicked ends. The lands fell into darkness and a great wailing was heard. But hope was not lost, 
                <br>for a young warrior of the Kokiri took his courage and simple wooden sword and pursued Ganon through dungeons, battles, and many hardships until he smote his foe into ruin, saving the realm and restoring the triforce.
                <br>
                <br>This is the Legend of Zelda.
                This is the story of Link.</p>
