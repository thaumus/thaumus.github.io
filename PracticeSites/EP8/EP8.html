            <h3>What we know so far...</h3>
            <p> Luke Skywalker begins training Rey on the planet Ahch-To as Finn recovers from his grevious wounds at the hands of Kylo Ren. <br>General Hux and the wounded Ren return to the mysterious homeworld of Supreme Leader Snoke to begin Kylo's dark side training in earnest. <br>Princess Leia, gravely wounded in a surprise attack, is forced to surrender power to a formidable female officer in the new Resistance, causing a fracture in the struggling army 
                <br>between those loyal to Leia, now led by Poe Dameron, 
                and those led by the Resistance Officer, portrayed by Laura Dern.</p>
